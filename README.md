# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LaoWater 

**I've dedicated my life towards understanding the Mind & Body.**  
The Body to the most intimate of biomechanics level,  
The Mind to the most intimate of thoughts & neural activations.  
And their interconnectivity.

Returned home from my journey in Asia with complete light upon this Mind & Body,  
I Returned to my childhood passion â€” The World Of Computers â€” but with a completely different sentiment.

Fears alchemized into curiosities.  
Fails into treasured lessons of the past.  
An inefficient, jumping-around Mind -> into a Clear, Focused, Content Mind.

I've spent countless nights learning â€” amazed how the Computer World mirrors the Human Mind â€” in living experiences rather than in theory & words.  
After taking the Harvard CS50 course to refresh my knowledge, I was drawn towards the **AI Revolution: The Neural Networks.**

The more I understood the Computer World, up to the beautiful symphony of 0s and 1s, the more I understood the Mind.  
With the power of the Computer World, as knowledge and use, I began to heal and understand chronic diseases of the digestive system, emotional eating, biomechanics, and breathing â€” chronic diseases which I carried around for years, seeking to cure them.

**I am completely in love with the World of Computers.**  
Programming languages became pure channels for expressing algorithms.

Just as the meaning of life is to be found beyond words,  
So does the World Of Programming weigh in my heart.  
Beyond programming languages.

**Most of my open-source projects are aimed towards making One's Life (and implied, the world) Easier, Healthier, more Connected.**
